Home Assistant Automation Blueprints

This is going to be a collection of Home Assistant Blueprints that I made for my own home.

Improvements, comments, and feedback are more than welcome!

My first bp is un upgrade of the officiel blue print of HA : Motion light

My version is for use with switch : https://github.com/viskor/HomeAssistantVK/blob/main/VKMotion-switch.yaml

For an integration with Start and stop hour (like 20h00 > 8h00 or 18h> 23h) 
- Switch Version : https://github.com/viskor/HomeAssistantVK/blob/main/VKMotion-time-power.yaml
